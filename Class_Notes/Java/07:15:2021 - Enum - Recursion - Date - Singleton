enum
-An enum (enumeration) is a special class representing a group of constants (unchangeable variables, like final variables) like days, months etc.
-To create an enum, use the enum keyword (instead of class or interface), and separate the constants with a comma
-We can create enum in a class as well

EX/
public enum Days{
	SUNDAY,
	MONDAY,
	TUESDAY,
	WEDNESDAY,
	THURSDAY,
	FRIDAY,
	SATURDAY
}

-values() method can be used to get all enum constants and we can get constants one by one to print/use with a for each loop



Recursion
-Recursion is the technique of making a function (method) call itself
-Basically, one method is invoking itself 
-Infinite recursion – method never stops calling itself
-In the case of infinite recursion, we will get StackOverflowError

-RECURSION IS JUST LIKE LOOP

-Recursive method
public void sum(){
	sum();
}


Singleton Design Pattern
-Singleton is a creational design pattern, which ensures that only one object of its kind exists and provides a single point of access to it for any other code
-It is very commonly used with driver instance for Selenium scripts
-It can be achieved by making constructor of the class private which prevents it to be instantiated anywhere else
-This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system
-This one object will be instantiated in the class and access will be given to it with a static get method


public class Car{
	private static Car car = new Car();

	private Car(){

	}

	public static Car getCar(){
		return car;
	}
}


main(String[] args){
	Car car1 = new Car(); // Compiler error
	Car car1 = Car.getCar();
	Car car2 = Car.getCar();
}


STEPS TO ACHIEVE SINGLETON
1. make default contructor private and do not overload it
2. create a private class object inside the class
3. provide a get method to get the single object and this method MUST be static because object cannot be created anywhere




Date Class
- Date class can be used to get current time like 
Thu Jul 14 22:33:41 CDT 2021

We can format the date using SimpleDateFormat class and get below formats
	yyyy-MM-dd	->	2021-07-15
	MM/dd/yyyy	->	07/15/2021
	dd-MMM-yyyy	-> 	15-Jul-2021
	E, MMM dd yyyy	->	Thu, Jul 15 2021
	hh:mm:ss a	->	08:33:27 PM
	h:mm a 		-> 	8:37 PM
	EEE 		-> 	Thu
	EEEE 		-> 	Thursday
