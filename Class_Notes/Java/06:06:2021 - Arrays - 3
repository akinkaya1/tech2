RECAP:
-It is a collection
-It allows us to store multiple data that are same data type
-Array is always fixed size

Syntax:
int[] numbers = new int[5]; // length = 5
String[] objects = {"pen", "book", "laptop"}; // length = 3

HOW TO FIND SIZE OF ARRAY?
arrayName.length

What is the difference between length and length()?
-length is used to find the size of the array and it will return the size as an int. It is basically, how many elements you have in an array
int size1 = numbers.length; // size1 = 5
int size2 = objects.length; // size2 = 3

-length() is a String class method and used to find the length of a String. It is basically, how many characters you have in a single String

String cName = "TechGlobal";
int size3 = cName.length(); // size3 = 10


HOW TO SORT AN ARRAY?
-sort() method can be used to sort the elements of the array
-it is a void and a static method
-Arrays.sort(objects); // [book, laptop, pen]

HOW TO PRINT AN ARRAY?
-toString() method is used to convert array into a String
-Arrays.toString(objects); //[book, laptop, pen]
-It is a static and return type method. 
-It takes an array argument and returns a String


How to find first and last element in an array?
String[] objects = {"pen", "book", "laptop"};

objects -> String array
objects[0] -> String -> pen
objects[1] -> String -> book
objects.length -> int -> 3

first element = objects[0]
last element = objects[objects.length-1] // 


For each loop - Enhanced for loop
SYNTAX:
for(dataType element: arrayName){
	// block of code to execute
}


HOW TO CHECK IF ARRAY HAS A PARTICULAR ELEMENT?
String[] objects = {"Remote", "Mouse", "Keyboard", "iPad"};

-binarySearch() method can be used to search an array for a particular element
-binarySearch() method is static and return type
-it takes 2 arguments - array, element
-it returns int
negative numbers -> it means element is not found in the array
positive numbers -> it means element is found in the array
zero -> it means element is found in the array


STEPS TO SEARCH AN ELEMENT
-sort the array (otherwise, you may get wrong result)
-then, Java will check if element exists in the array
	if so, it will return the index of the element
	if not, it will return -insertion index -1
