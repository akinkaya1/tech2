-Arrays we have learned till now are called one-dimensional arrays. However, we can declare multidimensional arrays in Java
-A multi dimensional array is an array containing one or more arrays
-Multi dimensional arrays are useful for creating tables
-When declaring two dimensional arrays, we don't have to set inner array sizes because subarray(inner array) can be any size for each outer array
-If we set inner size when declaring the two-dimensional array, that means all inner array sizes are same

TASK
Create a two dimensional array that holds numbers below

12 15 23
77 23 89

00 01 02
10 11 12

TASK
1 1 1 1
2 3 4 5
2 3 4 5  [3][4]

TASK
1 0 1
2 2 2
3 4 4
3 4 5 [4][3]

print entire array
print 5 and 0 from this 2 dimensional array

TASK

Raqi  Sarah  Maryna [2][3]

String[][] names = new String[2][3];
