RECAP:
-Any software application needs to put billions of information in a form that can be managed easily.
-packages and classes are just folders - shelves that you store your data

-CLASS MEMBERS:
1.Attributes
2.Methods
3.Constructor
4.Blocks


CONSTRUCTOR:
-It is a special method that is used to create objects
-We cannot create object without constructor
-Java provides default constructor once you create a new class
DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR
public ClassName(){
        
}

-Default constructor can be overloaded with different parameters. And these overloaded constructors are called as custom constructors.
-If you create your own custom constructor, the default one will be gone.
-After that, if you still want to create object with default constructor, you HAVE TO create default constructor explicitly
-CUSTOM CONSTRUCTORS are created to give initial information for the object created

-this is a reserved keyword in Java and used as reference to the current object of its type in a class
-this() is used to call a custom constructor in another custom constructor and provides code reusability
-this() must be the first statement in the constructor block it is called


RULES:
-its name must be same as class name
-it is always used next to new keyword
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);


WHAT IS DIFFERENCE BT CONSTRUCTOR AND METHOD?
-Constructors are special kind of methods that creates objects
-Unlike methods, constructor cannot be void or return type
-They always take same name as class
-We can overload both methods and constructors
-We can chain both methods and constructors but you cannot chain constructor in a method. You are allowed to call methods in constructors
-Methods can be final and static but Constructors cannot be final or static



4.BLOCKS
-block in Java is known coding statements in opening and closing curly braces {}

Syntax:
-An instance block
{
	//coding statements
}

-Static block
static {
	//coding statements
}

--All other blocks that we use with methods, constructors, loops, if-else statements, switch statements are LOCAL BLOCKS

 /*
        EXECUTION ORDER
        -JVM looks for main method()
        -It start executing code line by line top to bottom and left to right
        -When JVM sees a new object is getting created
            -First, it checks if object class has any static block, if so, it execute static block first
            -Secondly, before creating object, it also executes instance blocks if there are any
            -Finally, object will get created
            
        -Static block is the first to be executed before anything else in the class 
            and it is executed only once
        -Instance blocks are executed after static blocks and before everything else 
            and they are executed for each object being created
         */


-A block in Java is a set of code enclosed within curly braces { } within any class, method, orÂ constructor
-It begins with an opening brace { and ends with a closing braces }
-Between the opening and closing braces, we can write codes which may be a group of one or more statements



-Stack Heap
-Access modifiers
-OOP PRINCIPLES
	Encapsulation
	Inheritance
	Abstraction
	Polymorphism
-Collections
	Set -> HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet
	Map -> HashMap, HashTable, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap

-Exceptions
-Files
-Date class
