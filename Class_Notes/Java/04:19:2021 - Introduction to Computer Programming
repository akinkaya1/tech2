What is computer?
-It is a machine processing information
-It is a machine takes instructions from user and return output based on instructions
-input: is the data provided user
-computer process data and outputs data
-output: the result computer gives back

-binary form: ones and zeros

-CPU: Central Processing Unit - brain of the computer

A computer is an electronic machine that is used to input, process, and then output data, typically in binary form, according to instructions given to it in a variable program


Counting system:

Oldest way of counting ->||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

Binary 0 1 -> 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024

Decimal 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9-> 1 10 100 1000 10000 100000

5 times 1000 -> 5000
3 times 10 -> 30
5 times 1 -> 5
5035

binary digit -> bit 
1 bit is either 1 or 0
8 bits -> 1 byte
1024 bytes -> 1 kilobyte and it goes like that to megabyte, gigabyte, terabyte ... zettabyte

95 is represented by 01011111 in binary system

Java -> 01001010011000010111011001100001
