RECAP:

Variable: it is a special container that holds a piece of data

EXAMPLE: int age = 25;
age is the container name - variable name
int is the dataType
25 is the value of age

dataType variableName = value; // declaring and assigning
dataType variableName; // declaration
variableName = value; // assignment

DECLARATION: allocating memory 
ASSIGMENT: putting a value to the allocated container

VARIABLE NAMING - NAMING CONVENTION
-variable names: starts with lowercase, then follows camelcase
-packages: starts with lowercase, then follows camelcase
-classes: starts with uppercase, then follows camelcase
-methods: starts with lowercase, then follows camelcase

JAVA RESERVED KEYWORDS: public, static, void, int, byte so on..

-We cannot use those reserved keywords to name our variables, packages, classes and so on.


String Class
-String is a Java class and can be used to store a sequence of characters

EXAMPLE: String schoolName = "TEchGlobal";

String CONCATENATION:
-It is making a String that is combination of multiple Strings

1.by using + operator
2.by using concat() method

PSEUDO CODE:
-Step by step instruction of our programs - not too technical


ESCAPE SEQUENCES
-These are special characters that can be inserted to our texts

1. double quotation ->  It is not possible to use double quotes inside another double quotes in JAVA (compiler error)
-To solve this issue, we can use back slach \ in front of each inner double quotes

String s = " \"inner double quotes\" ";

1. \n : n stands fow "new line" and it moves cursor to next line

2. \t : t stands "tab" and it inserts one tab space


package
//There cannot be any code here
//Only import statement
public class Test {

    //Some members of the class can be written here as well. 
	//Outside of the main() method



    public static void main(String[] args) {
    //All the code that we want to run goes into main() method

        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }


}

//There cannot be any code as well



SCANNER
-Scanner is a Java class that is used to read input from user
-It is located in java.util package
-To be able to use Scanner, we have to create an object and import it first

Scanner myScanner = new Scanner(System.in);

-new keyword is reserved keyword in Java and it is used to created objects
-Without new keyword, we cannot create any objects
-For each new Object, we have to use new keyword

Integer age = 25;
String name = "Lionel";

Integer age = new Integer(25);
String name = new String("Lionel");

next() method
-next() is one of the methods belongs to Scanner class
-It is used to read next String (only one word) from user

Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println(“Please enter a string”);
String str = scanner.next();

nextLine()
-nextLine() is another method belongs to Scanner class
-It is used to read the next line (full line) of String from user

Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println(“Please enter a sentence”);
String str = scanner.nextLine();

next() vs nextLine()
-next() method is going to read only one word (till first space) while nextLine() reads all line



int age1 = 45; // number
int age2 = 35;

String age3 = "45"; // text
String age4 = "35"; // text

age1 + age2 = 80

age3 + age4 = 4535
