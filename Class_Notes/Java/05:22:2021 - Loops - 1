-Loops in Java are used to execute a block of code repeatedly
-Loops will run until a termination condition is met
-Loops are helpful to eliminate duplicating codes and time saving


1. For loop (traditional i loop or i loop)

Syntax:

for(initialization; termination condition; change){
	//code block to be executed
}

initialization -> startPoint -> int i = 0; int i = 1;
termination condition -> endPoint -> condition to stop
change -> update -> update after each iteration

ITERATION -> each repeated execution in the loop
INFINITE LOOP -> when there is no termination point and your loop runs forever


NOTE;if you started a variable inside a block, you cannot use that outside of the block: COMPILER ERROR

WHEN WE CAN USE FOR I LOOP?
-When we know the start point, end point and update
-When you know how many times that your loop will run
-You know the iteration number

for(start; terminationCondition; update){
	
}


2. while loop
Syntax:

while(test condition){
	//code block to be executed
}

-While loop executes a block of code depending on a condition
-While condition is true, the block of code will be executed

FOR LOOP VS WHILE LOOP
-For loop is used to execute a block of code and preferred when we know the exact number of iteration
-While loop is used to execute a block of based on a condition and total number of iteration is not certain (dynamic)
-While loop can be used instead of for loop
