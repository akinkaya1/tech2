RECAP:

Array vs ArrayList
-Array has a fixed size while ArrayList is dynamic considering size. This means, you cannor add or remove elements from array but you can add or remove elements to/from an ArrayList
-ArrayList can be used with Objects only, but array can be used with both objects and primitives
-ArrayList has many useful methods to manipulate data but not array
-We can find the size of the array with length method, and we can find the size of the ArrayList with size() method
-We can search for an element in array using binarySearch() method while we can use contains() method to search for an element in an ArrayList
-SYNTAX
-Access element 
-Add element
-Print
-Sorting


ArrayList vs LinkedList
-LinkedList implements Queue and Deque and it has more useful methods to manipulate data
-LinkedList is faster than ArrayList when we remove or add elements
-LinkedList allocates more memory compared to ArrayList as it holds each data with 3 information


HOW TO SORT AN ARRAYLIST OR LINKEDLIST?
-Collections.sort(list);
