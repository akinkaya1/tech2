1.Print each statement below in one println() statement

My favorite author is “Stefan Zweig”
My favorite quote is “All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them.” 
In my free time:
-I “read books”,
-I “swim”,
-I “watch movies”.

NOTE: double quotations, escape character to move to next line

Escape character "" -> if you are going to use double quotation in double quotation, you need to use \ (back slash) in front of each inner double quotation

Example ->   "abc \"QWQ\" xyz"

\n -> this moves our cursor to next line
\t -> this inserts one tab space at the beginning of string


2.Do exercises on https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp

1. Primitives
2. Reference types (objects) - non-primitives

Wrapper classes are object representation of primitives

JAVA OPERATORS
Assignment operator -> = equal sign
Arithmetic operators -> + plus used for addition
						- minus used for subtraction
						* star used for multiplication
						/ slash used for division
						% percentage used to find remainder

15 % 6 = 3		-> 15 = 2*6 + 3
5 % 4 = 1		-> 5 = 4*1 + 1
23 % 5 = 3 		-> 23 = 5*4 + 3
25 % 5 = 0      -> 25 = 5*5 + 0

Any number's remainder by itself will be zero
100 % 100 = 0	-> 100 = 100*1 + 0
7 % 7 = 0		-> 7 = 7*1 + 0

if we are looking a remainder of x number with number y and y > x, then remainder is x itself

15 % 20 = 15  	-> 15 = 0*20 + 15
5 % 32 = 5 		-> 5 = 0*32 + 5


3. Write a program that asks user below questions
1 - What is your full name?
2 - What is your age?
3 - What are your favorite activities?
4 - Do you like playing video games? true/false
5 - What are your favorite colors?
6 - Do you like Tesla? true/false
7 - What kind of cars do you like?
8 - What is your favorite letter?
9 - Which countries you would like to visit?
10 - What is the result of 5/2?

ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS MUST FOLLOW AS BELOW
1 - John Doe
2 - 40
3 - Listening to music, hanging out
4 - false
5 -Yellow, green, red, blue
6 - true
7 - Mercedes, BMW, Maserati
8 - T
9 - Italy, Mexico, Brasilia
10 - 2.5

EXPECTED RESULTS OF PROGRAM
User’s full name is = John Doe
User’s age is = 40
User’s hobbies are = Listening to music, hanging out
Does user like video games = false
User’s favorite colors are = Yellow, green, red, blue
Does user like Tesla = true
User’s favorite cars are = Mercedes, BMW, Maserati
User’s favorite letter is = T
User wants to visit countries = Italy, Mexico, Brasilia
The result of 5/2 = 2.5
