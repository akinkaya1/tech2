-if else statement short cut
if(condition){
	// 1 statement
}
else{
	//another statement
}

This can be written in this way as well
if(condition) // 1 statement
else //another statement

THIS CAN HAPPEN ONLY IF YOU ARE RUNNING ONE LINE OF CODE

NOTE: new keyword in Java is used to create new objects. So, whenever new keyword is used, it means an object created
EX/ Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);


number divided by 2 and 5 means-> number divided by 10

random % 2 == 0 && random % 5 == 0

random % 10 == 0

number can be divided by 4 and 5 at the same time 20
random % 20 == 0
random % 4 == 0 && random % 5 == 0


number can be divided by 2 and 3 at the same time
random % 6 == 0
