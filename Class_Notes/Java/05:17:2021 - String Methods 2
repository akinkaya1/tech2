RECAP:

String: It is a Java class that allows us to store a sequence of characters

String class has many useful methods for us to use and modify data

1.toLowerCase() -> converts a String to lowercase
2.toUpperCase() -> converts a String to uppercase
3.equals() 	-> compares 2 strings and returns true/false
4.equalsIgnoreCase() -> compares 2 strings and returns true/false but ignores cases
5.concat() -> combines 2 strings and creates a new one
6.valueOf() -> converts primitives to String
7.charAt() -> it gets the char at given index

-return type method
-returns a char
-nonstatic method
-it takes one argument - int

public char charAt(int index){
	//some other code statements
	return char;
}


String s = "TechGlobal";

charAt(5) 	-> l
charAt(8) 	-> a
charAt(10) 	-> StringIndexOutOfBoundException


8.	indexOf(char)
	indexOf(String)
9. 	lastIndexOf(char)
	lastIndexOf(String)

String s = "TechGlobal";
s.indexOf('G'); 	-> 4
s.indexOf('e'); 	-> 1
s.indexOf("h"); 	-> 3
s.indexOf('l'); 	-> 5
s.indexOf("lo"); 	-> 5
s.indexOf("X"); 	-> -1 (not found)
s.indexOf("Techglobal") -> -1 (not found)
s.indexOf("TechGlobal") -> 0

-indexOf() will always return the first index that is match
-indexOf(String) will always return the index of first char of the argument
-the method will return -1 if given char or string is not found in the given string

-indexOf() and lastIndexOf() methods are return type and they return an int
-they are non-static
-they are overloaded method and there are 4 of them

10. length()
-it is used to find length of a specified string
-This method is going to return the length as an int 
-length = total number of characters in a string
NOTE: space is also a character

String s = "TechGlobal";
s.length() 	-> 10

String s = "TechGlobal School";
s.length() 	-> 17

-it is used to find length of a specified string
-it is a return type method and it returns an int
-it is a non-static method
-it is non-args method

11. trim()
-it is used to remove whitespaces from both ends of a String
-This method is going to return the given string back but clears spaces before and after the string
-NOTE: it will take all spaces before and after the string

-it is a return type and it returns a String
-it is a non-static method
-it is a non-args method


12.	substring(index)
	substring(beginIndex, endIndex)

-We will learn 2 overloaded substring methods
-they are used to extract the characters from a string
-they are return types and returning strings
-they are non-static methods
-if given indexes are not found, then they will throw StringIndexOutOfBoundException


13. startsWith()
14. endsWith()

String s = "TechGlobal";
s.startsWith("Tech"); 	-> true
s.endsWith("bal"); 		-> true

s.startsWith("TechGlobal"); 	-> true
s.endsWith("TechGlobal"); 		-> true

-startsWith() method is used to check whether a string starts with the specified character(s)
-This method is going to return true if the string starts with given sequence of character(s) and false if the string does not start with given sequence of character(s). 
-So, the return type of this method is boolean

-endsWith() method is used to check whether a string ends with the specified character(s)
-This method is going to return true if the string ends with given sequence of character(s) and false if the string does not end with given sequence of character(s). 
-So, the return type of this method is boolean


-These methods are used to find out if a string starts or ends with another string
-These are return types and they return boolean
-They are non-static methods
-Both taking one arg which is a string


15. contains()
-contains() method is used to check whether a string contains a sequence of characters or not
-This method is going to return true if the string contains given sequence of characters and false if the string does  not contain given sequence of characters 
-So, the return type of this method is boolean

String s = "TechGlobal";
s.contains("x"); 	-> false
s.contains("tech") 	-> false
s.contains("Tech") 	-> true
s.contains("") 		-> true
s.contains(" ") 	-> false

-this method is used to check whether a string contains a sequence of characters or not
-it is a return type method and returns a boolean
-it is non-static
-it takes a String as argument


16. isEmpty()
-isEmpty() method is used to check whether a string is empty or not
-This method is going to return true if the string is empty and false if the string is not empty
-So, the return type of this method is boolean
-this method is used to check whether a string is empty or not
-it is a return type method and it returns a boolean
-it is a non-static method
-it is a non-args method


17. replace()

TechCompany -> Company with Global

METHOD CHAINING
-We can use many methods in a single line by chaining them and this is called as method chaining in Java


Raqi   -> 0 3 length()-1
Sarah  -> 0 4
Yasser -> 0 5  6-3 = 3

s.charAt(0) -> always returns first char from given String 
s.charAt(s.length()-1) -> always returns last char

s.substring(0,3); -> the first 3 chars
s.substring(s.length()-3); -> the last 3 chars
