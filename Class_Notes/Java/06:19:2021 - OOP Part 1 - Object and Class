Class: is a blueprint or template from where we can create objects

Object: is an instance of a class

Class members: methods, attributes, constructor, blocks

Some Java classes: String, Scanner, Arrays, ArrayList, Random, LinkedList, Math, Integer, Character, System

Custom classes: RandomNumberGenerator, MathHelper


How to create an Object:
-Objects can only be created using "new" keyword
-The purpose of "new" keyword in Java is to create objects
className variableName = new className();

Class -> Random
Object -> Random myRandom = new Random();

Random is a class and myRandom is an instance of the Random class


JAVA IS AN OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
-programming languages can be used to create software
-Software is created to resolve real life problems
-Java is an object-oriented programming
-The core concept of the object-oriented approach is to break complex problems into smaller objects. So, Object-oriented simply known as an approach to programming that breaks a programming problem into objects
-Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects
-Different Java objects can interact with each other



DATATYPES IN JAVA?
-2 different data types in Java
	Primitive types -> 8 like int, short, long, double
	Reference types -> objects

HOW TO CREATE A CLASS?
Syntax:

accessModifier class ClassName{
	//class members
}

public class Car{
	//class members
}


HOW TO CREATE AN OBJECT?
Syntax:

ClassName variableName = new ClassName();

Car myCar1 = new Car();
Car myCar2 = new Car();


EXAMPLES:
Class -> Car
Objects -> BMW 335i, BMW X5, Mercedes C63AMG, Toyota Corolla, Ford Focus, Audi Q7, myCar, yourCar

Class -> Food
Objects -> Salad, steak, kebap, sushi, myFood, smoothie

Class -> Restaurant
Objects -> McDonalds, Subway, Chama


Class -> Student
Objects -> Salih, Raqi, Sarah, Volkan


Attributes: What an object has
Behaviors: What an object does

-> Attributes: Name, LastName, DOB, Gender, Height, Weight, SSN, PhoneNumber, Email, Address

-> Behaviors: study(), doHomework(), attendClass(), beLate(), askQuestions()


Attributes - States - Fields - Instance variables
Behaviors - Functions - Methods


-Every class has its attributes and methods
-Attributes are known as instance variables or fields
-Methods are functions of that class

For example:
In real life, a car is an object. 
The car has attributes, such as brand and color 
And the car has methods, such as drive and brake.


-Object is an instance of a class
-Class is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. 
-So, object is the instance(result) of a class

EXAMPLE: if car is a class, then BMW can be an object of that class. BMW is known as instance of car class. Also, Audi is an instance of car class


CLASS MEMBERS
1.Attributes - fields

-Class attributes are known as fields or instance variables of a class
-Fields are used to store data
-Fields can be accessed by objects of that class 
For example:
If car is a class, below can be its fields
year, make, model, trim, color, etc.

EXAMPLE
public class Car {
	//Instance variables of Car class
	int year;
	String make;
	String model;
	String trim:
	String color;
}

NOTE: If we do not define some fields (information) for the objects created, they will get DEFAULT values of data types

NOTE: These DEFAULT values can be decided by proggrammer as their need. To do this, we need to give an initial value when we declare instance variables



CLASS & OBJECT
Class: blueprint or template that we can create many object from

Object: It is an instance of a class

How to create class and objects of that class

public class Car{
	//all class member
}

Car car1 = new Car(); //
Car car2 = new Car();

Car car3; // declaration
car3 = new Car();


String name;
name = "Lionel"; 


4 Access modifiers -> public, protected, default, private


CLASS MEMBERS: 4 members
1.Attributes - fields - instance variables - states
2.Methods - functions - behavior
3.Constructor
4.Blocks
