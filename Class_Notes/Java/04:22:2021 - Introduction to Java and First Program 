-Computer is a machine that takes instructions from users, process and returns soome output.
-It is machine that does what ever we tell


-Terminal (Mac) or command prompt (Windows) is used to execute specific tasks over machine

java -version -> is to check what java version you have on your machine

javac -version -> is to check what java compiler version you have on your machine

javac -> java compiler


Home Directory -> first directory opens on terminal or command prompt

A home directory is a file system directory on a multi-user operating system containing files for a given user of the system.


COMMON COMMANDS
1. ls -> dir for Windows
-it shows the list of folders/files in the working directory

2. pwd -> cd for Windows
-print working directory -> it shows us which directory we are working on 
-SEE WHERE YOU ARE

3. cd directoryName -> change directory
- it is used to navigate to specified directory

PATH -> /Users/techglobal/Desktop/MyDirectory
it is the address of specific folders stored

4. cd .. -> move up to the tree (to parent directory)
-it ise used to navigate back to parent directory

5. cd / -> 
-it is used to move up to starting directory

6. clear - cls fow Windows
-it is use to clear terminal or command prompt

7. mkdir directoryName -> make directory
-it is used to create directory (folder)
-to name directory with multiple words, use ""
Example/ mkdir "My New Folder"

-to create multiple folders at the same time, give space and don't use double quotation ""
Example/ mkdir Apple Orange Banana

8. rm -rf -> rmdir/s/q
-it is used to remove directories


PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
-Set of rules to tell computer what to do
-Programing languages lack ambiguity
Example: I saw the man with a telescope. Who has the telescope? Example: May I borrow some milk? Computer will not understand some!!!
-SYNTAX: it is the grammar of programming language and we have to follow all syntax rules

Programming Languages:  C, C++, C#, Ruby, Java, Pyhton
						JavaScript

Operating System: Windows, MAC, Linux
-Java can run in all of those operating systems, that is why it is platform independent
-Java is platform independent thanks to JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

"WRITE ONCE RUN EVERYWHERE"
-Java is one of the most demanded programming languages in the field
-Java is easy to learn
-There is huge community that supports java learners
-Java can be used for web and Android mobile application, games etc.


RUNNING FIRST JAVA PROGRAM
-to compile the code-> javac directoryName.java
-to run the code-> java directoryName
