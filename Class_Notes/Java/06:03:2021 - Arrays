-Arrays is a class stored java.util package
-Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value
-Array is one of the collection types in java
-Collection is storing multiple similar items in one place
-By using an Array, we can store many similar items/elements in one variable

-To declare an array, define the variable type withÂ square brackets

EXAMPLE:
How to create an array

SYNTAX:
dataType[] variableName = new dataType[size];

1. String array
String[] fruits = new String[10];

2. int array (primitive)
int[] numbers = new int[3];

3. char array (primitive)
char[] letters = new char[4];

NOTE: We have to declare the size - length of the array when we initialize it. Otherwise, we will get a compiler error

-Size defines how many elements that we are going to store in the array
-ELEMENT: each data we store in array is known as an element of that array

HOW TO PRINT AN ARRAY
-We can use toString() method to convert array to a String and print that String

-toString() method is a return type and it returns a String. It is also static and can be called with class name (Arrays)


HOW TO GET THE SIZE OF THE ARRAY
-size is how many elements array has
-length method can be used to get size of the array

EXAMPLE
int[] arr = new int[13];
System.out.println(arr.length); // 13


DEFAULT VALUES FOR DIFFERENT ARRAYS
String  -> null (same for all other objects like Wrappers)
int 	-> 0 	(byte, short and long are same)
double 	-> 0.0 	(float is same)
boolean -> false
char 	-> nothing
